Certainly! To create a similar example using Markov chains instead of vector-based methods, we'll implement a Python script that:

1. Defines a simple ontology for C++ code structures.
2. Represents each C++ code structure as a Markov chain model.
3. Compares the sequence of tokens in a C++ snippet to the Markov chain models to identify the most likely structure.

### Python Code:

```python
import re
import random
from collections import defaultdict, Counter

# 1. Define a simple ontology for C++ code structures with corresponding example sequences.
ontology = {
    'class': "class { public: private: protected: };",
    'function': "return type name() { statements }",
    'loop': "for() {} while() {} do {} while();",
    'conditional': "if() {} else {} switch() {} case:",
    'variable_declaration': "type name = value;",
}

# 2. Tokenize the ontology examples to create Markov chains.
def tokenize(text):
    # Simple tokenization based on splitting by whitespace and punctuation.
    return re.findall(r'\b\w+\b|[{}();]', text)

def build_markov_chain(tokens, order=1):
    # Build a Markov chain of the given order from a sequence of tokens.
    markov_chain = defaultdict(Counter)
    for i in range(len(tokens) - order):
        state = tuple(tokens[i:i + order])
        next_token = tokens[i + order]
        markov_chain[state][next_token] += 1
    return markov_chain

ontology_chains = {}
for structure, example in ontology.items():
    tokens = tokenize(example)
    ontology_chains[structure] = build_markov_chain(tokens)

# 3. Define function to calculate the likelihood of a sequence matching a Markov chain.
def calculate_likelihood(chain, tokens, order=1):
    likelihood = 0
    for i in range(len(tokens) - order):
        state = tuple(tokens[i:i + order])
        next_token = tokens[i + order]
        if next_token in chain[state]:
            # Add the logarithm of the transition probability
            likelihood += chain[state][next_token]
        else:
            # Penalize for unseen transitions
            likelihood -= 1
    return likelihood

# 4. C++ code snippets representing different structures.
cpp_code_snippets = [
    "class MyClass { public: void myFunction() {} };",  # Class definition
    "int main() { int x = 0; for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { x += i; } return x; }",  # Loop in main function
    "if (x > 0) { y = 1; } else { y = -1; }",  # Conditional
    "int x = 10;",  # Variable declaration
    "double square(double num) { return num * num; }"  # Function definition
]

# 5. Identify the structure of each C++ code snippet using the Markov chains.
for code_snippet in cpp_code_snippets:
    tokens = tokenize(code_snippet)
    likelihoods = {}
    
    for structure, chain in ontology_chains.items():
        likelihood = calculate_likelihood(chain, tokens)
        likelihoods[structure] = likelihood
    
    identified_structure = max(likelihoods, key=likelihoods.get)
    print(f"Code Snippet: '{code_snippet}'\nIdentified as: {identified_structure}\n")

```

### Explanation:

1. **Ontology**: The ontology maps different C++ code structures to example sequences, which will be used to train Markov chains.

2. **Tokenization**: The `tokenize` function breaks down the C++ code examples into sequences of tokens. This is crucial for building the Markov chains and comparing sequences.

3. **Markov Chain Model**: The `build_markov_chain` function builds a Markov chain of order 1 (considering one previous token) for each structure in the ontology.

4. **Likelihood Calculation**: The `calculate_likelihood` function computes how likely a given sequence of tokens (from the C++ code snippet) matches the Markov chain for each structure.

5. **Identification**: For each C++ snippet, the script calculates the likelihood of it matching each structure's Markov chain. The structure with the highest likelihood is considered the best match.

### Output:
The script will output which C++ structure each code snippet is identified as, based on the Markov chains.

This approach, unlike vector-based methods, leverages the sequential nature of tokens, which can be especially effective in identifying patterns in structured text like code.
