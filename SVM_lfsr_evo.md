Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) are useful in generating pseudo-random sequences with specific properties that make them suitable for cryptography, error detection, and evolutionary strategies. In the context of an evolutionary strategy, LFSRs can replace purely random mutation and crossover operations, providing deterministic and repeatable sequences that can be fine-tuned for more controlled evolutionary processes.

### Overview of the Strategy

1. **LFSR Integration**:
   - We'll introduce LFSRs to generate pseudo-random sequences used in mutation and crossover operations.
   - The LFSR will be encapsulated in a separate class that also integrates with the SVM model, allowing the evolutionary strategy to be more controlled and less reliant on pure randomness.

2. **SVM with LFSR**:
   - The SVM will utilize the LFSR sequences to guide the mutation and crossover operations in the evolutionary strategy.
   - The idea is to map the LFSR-generated sequences to feature spaces that influence the function prototypes' fitness scores.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

#### 1. LFSR Class Implementation

We begin by creating an LFSR class to handle the generation of pseudo-random sequences.

```python
class LFSR:
    def __init__(self, seed, taps):
        self.state = seed
        self.taps = taps
        self.n_bits = len(bin(seed)) - 2  # Number of bits in the seed

    def step(self):
        # Perform one LFSR step and update the state
        xor = 0
        for tap in self.taps:
            xor ^= (self.state >> tap) & 1
        self.state = (self.state >> 1) | (xor << (self.n_bits - 1))
        return self.state

    def generate_sequence(self, length):
        return [self.step() for _ in range(length)]
```

#### 2. Enhancing the SVM Class to Use LFSR

We'll extend the SVM class to use LFSR sequences for generating candidates during the evolutionary process.

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures, StandardScaler
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

class SVMWithLFSR:
    def __init__(self, svm_model, vectorizer, poly_features, lfsr):
        self.svm_model = svm_model
        self.vectorizer = vectorizer
        self.poly_features = poly_features
        self.lfsr = lfsr

    def svm_fitness(self, candidate):
        candidate_vector = self.vectorizer.transform([candidate]).toarray()
        high_dim_vector = self.poly_features.transform(candidate_vector)
        
        decision_scores = self.svm_model.decision_function(high_dim_vector)
        
        # Fitness is based on the magnitude of the decision score
        return np.max(decision_scores)
    
    def mutate_candidate(self, candidate):
        mutation_sequence = self.lfsr.generate_sequence(len(candidate))
        mutated_candidate = list(candidate)
        for i in range(len(mutated_candidate)):
            if mutation_sequence[i] % 2 == 1:  # Use LFSR to decide mutation
                mutated_candidate[i] = chr((ord(mutated_candidate[i]) + mutation_sequence[i]) % 127)
        return ''.join(mutated_candidate)
    
    def crossover_candidates(self, parent1, parent2):
        crossover_sequence = self.lfsr.generate_sequence(len(parent1))
        child1 = list(parent1)
        child2 = list(parent2)
        for i in range(len(crossover_sequence)):
            if crossover_sequence[i] % 2 == 1:  # Use LFSR to decide crossover points
                child1[i], child2[i] = child2[i], child1[i]
        return ''.join(child1), ''.join(child2)
    
    def evolutionary_strategy(self, prototypes, generations=10, population_size=50):
        def worker(prototype):
            score = self.svm_fitness(prototype)
            return prototype, score
        
        population = prototypes * (population_size // len(prototypes))  # Initial population

        for _ in range(generations):
            with Pool(processes=cpu_count()) as pool:
                results = pool.map(worker, population)

            # Select top 50% based on fitness
            sorted_results = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
            selected_candidates = [result[0] for result in sorted_results[:population_size // 2]]

            # Crossover and Mutation using LFSR sequences
            new_candidates = []
            for i in range(len(selected_candidates) // 2):
                parent1 = selected_candidates[i]
                parent2 = selected_candidates[-i-1]
                child1, child2 = self.crossover_candidates(parent1, parent2)
                new_candidates.extend([self.mutate_candidate(child1), self.mutate_candidate(child2)])
            
            population = selected_candidates + new_candidates

        # Return the best candidate based on fitness
        best_prototype, _ = sorted(results, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[0]
        return best_prototype
```

#### 3. Training and Running the Evolutionary Strategy

We'll train the SVM model and use the `SVMWithLFSR` class to manage the evolutionary strategy.

```python
# Example labeled dataset
cpp_code_snippets = [
    ("int add(int a, int b);", "math"),
    ("void print(const std::string& message);", "io"),
    ("double power(double base, int exponent);", "math"),
    ("int main() { int x = 10; return x; }", "main"),
    ("class MyClass { public: void myFunction(); };", "class_method"),
    ("void logError(const std::string& error);", "io"),
    ("double sqrt(double x);", "math"),
    ("void init();", "init"),
]

# 1. Extract function prototypes and their labels.
function_prototypes = [snippet[0] for snippet in cpp_code_snippets]
labels = [snippet[1] for snippet in cpp_code_snippets]

# 2. Vectorize the function prototypes.
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
prototype_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(function_prototypes).toarray()

# 3. Apply polynomial kernel to enhance dimensionality.
polynomial_features = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3, interaction_only=False)
high_dim_vectors = polynomial_features.fit_transform(prototype_vectors)

# 4. Train/Test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(high_dim_vectors, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# 5. Train SVM model
svm_classifier = make_pipeline(StandardScaler(), SVC(kernel='linear', probability=True))
svm_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 6. Evaluate the model
y_pred = svm_classifier.predict(X_test)
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))

# 7. Initialize the LFSR
lfsr = LFSR(seed=0b10111001, taps=[7, 5, 4, 3])  # Example taps

# 8. Instantiate the SVM with LFSR Class
svm_with_lfsr = SVMWithLFSR(svm_model=svm_classifier.named_steps['svc'], vectorizer=vectorizer, poly_features=polynomial_features, lfsr=lfsr)

# 9. Example Evolutionary Strategy Application
if not function_prototypes:
    print("No function prototypes found in the provided code snippets.")
else:
    best_prototype = svm_with_lfsr.evolutionary_strategy(function_prototypes)
    print(f"Best Function Prototype based on SVM with LFSR: '{best_prototype}'")
```

### Key Enhancements:

1. **LFSR for Controlled Randomness**:
   - LFSR sequences replace purely random numbers in mutation and crossover operations. This introduces determinism and control into the evolutionary process while still allowing for sufficient exploration of the search space.

2. **SVM Class with LFSR**:
   - The `SVMWithLFSR` class wraps the SVM model and manages evolutionary strategies, mutation, and crossover operations using LFSR-generated sequences. This encapsulation allows for a clean and modular design.

3. **Deterministic and Repeatable Evolutionary Strategies**:
   - By leveraging LFSRs, the evolutionary strategy becomes deterministic, meaning that given the same initial conditions, it will always produce the same results. This is beneficial for debugging, testing, and understanding the evolutionary process.

4. **Efficient Exploration**:
   - The controlled pseudo-random sequences generated by the LFSR help ensure that the evolutionary process explores the search space effectively while avoiding redundant or trivial mutations.

### Output:

The script outputs the best function prototype identified by the evolutionary strategy guided by the SVM model and the LFSR. This approach allows for a more structured and deterministic exploration of the search space, which can be advantageous in certain scenarios.

This implementation demonstrates how LFSRs can be effectively integrated into evolutionary strategies to enhance control, repeatability, and potentially lead to more optimized solutions. Let me know if further refinements are needed!
