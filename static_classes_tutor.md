In C++, ensuring that a class constructor is invoked in a way that suggests no destruction can be tricky, as the language inherently manages object lifetimes. However, there are some strategies you can employ to optimize your code for better performance and memory sharing:

1. **Static or Global Objects**: By using static or global objects, you can ensure that the object is constructed once and persists for the lifetime of the program. This avoids repeated construction and destruction.

    ```cpp
    class MyClass {
    public:
        MyClass() { /* constructor code */ }
    };

    static MyClass myObject; // Static object, constructed once
    ```

2. **Placement New**: You can use placement new to construct objects in a pre-allocated memory buffer. This allows you to control the object's lifetime manually.

    ```cpp
    #include <new> // Required for placement new

    class MyClass {
    public:
        MyClass() { /* constructor code */ }
        ~MyClass() { /* destructor code */ }
    };

    alignas(MyClass) char buffer[sizeof(MyClass)];
    MyClass* myObject = new (buffer) MyClass; // Placement new
    ```

3. **Memory Pools**: Implementing a memory pool can help manage the allocation and deallocation of objects efficiently. This can reduce the overhead of frequent allocations and deallocations.

    ```cpp
    class MyClass {
    public:
        MyClass() { /* constructor code */ }
        ~MyClass() { /* destructor code */ }
    };

    class MemoryPool {
        // Implementation of memory pool
    };

    MemoryPool pool;
    MyClass* myObject = pool.allocate<MyClass>(); // Allocate from pool
    ```

4. **Avoiding Destructors**: If you truly need to avoid destructors, you might consider using `std::shared_ptr` with a custom deleter that does nothing. This is a bit unconventional and should be used with caution.

    ```cpp
    #include <memory>

    class MyClass {
    public:
        MyClass() { /* constructor code */ }
        ~MyClass() { /* destructor code */ }
    };

    auto no_op_deleter = [](MyClass*) {};
    std::shared_ptr<MyClass> myObject(new MyClass, no_op_deleter);
    ```

5. **Compiler Optimizations**: Use compiler-specific attributes or pragmas to hint at optimizations. For example, GCC and Clang support the `__attribute__((optimize))` attribute.

    ```cpp
    class MyClass {
    public:
        __attribute__((optimize("O3"))) MyClass() { /* constructor code */ }
    };
    ```

These techniques can help you manage object lifetimes and optimize memory usage, but they should be used judiciously to avoid introducing complexity and potential bugs into your code. Always profile and test your code to ensure that these optimizations are beneficial in your specific use case.
