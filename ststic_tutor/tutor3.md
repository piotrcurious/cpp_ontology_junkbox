In embedded systems, optimizing memory usage (both RAM and Flash) is crucial. One technique involves telling the C++ compiler that certain objects or functions will never be destroyed, which allows the compiler to optimize these objects by sharing constants and static code among classes. Here's how you can achieve this:

### Step 1: Use `constexpr` and `const` for Constants

When defining constants or data that will not change, use the `constexpr` or `const` keywords to indicate to the compiler that these values are known at compile time and should be stored in Flash memory rather than RAM.

```cpp
constexpr int MY_CONSTANT = 42;  // Will be stored in Flash memory
const int MY_OTHER_CONSTANT = 99;  // Also stored in Flash memory
```

### Step 2: Use `inline` Functions and Methods

For small functions that are frequently called, use the `inline` keyword. This suggests to the compiler that the function should be expanded at each call site rather than being called via a regular function call, which can reduce the overhead and allow sharing of the same inline function across multiple translation units.

```cpp
inline int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

### Step 3: Mark Classes and Objects as `constexpr` or `static`

If a class object will never be destroyed and has no runtime state that will change, mark it as `constexpr`. This tells the compiler that the object can be initialized at compile-time, allowing it to be stored in Flash and shared across different parts of the program.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    constexpr MyClass(int x) : value(x) {}
    constexpr int getValue() const { return value; }
private:
    const int value;
};

constexpr MyClass myStaticObject(10);  // Will be stored in Flash memory
```

### Step 4: Use Placement of Data in Flash Memory

In embedded systems, you can instruct the compiler to place specific data in Flash memory sections using attributes or pragmas. For example:

```cpp
// Placing data in Flash memory using GCC specific attributes
const char myFlashString[] __attribute__((section(".rodata"))) = "Hello, Flash!";
```

### Step 5: Use `static` Methods and Member Functions

Use `static` methods and member functions whenever possible. Static functions do not require an instance of the class to be invoked, so they are allocated only once and can be shared across different uses.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    static int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
};
```

### Step 6: Use `__attribute__((const))` and `__attribute__((pure))` in GCC

In GCC (common for many embedded systems), you can use attributes to help the compiler optimize. The `const` attribute tells the compiler that a function does not read or modify any global memory, except for its arguments, while `pure` tells the compiler that the function has no side effects other than its return value.

```cpp
int square(int x) __attribute__((const));
int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
```

### Step 7: Use the `-ffunction-sections` and `-fdata-sections` Compiler Options

These GCC compiler flags instruct the compiler to place each function or data item in its own section in the object file. Combined with the `-Wl,--gc-sections` linker flag, this enables the linker to remove unused functions or data, minimizing the overall size of the code and sharing only necessary code sections.

### Embedded System Use Cases

#### Scenario 1: Optimizing ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) Functions

ISRs are frequently invoked and must be optimized for speed. Declaring them `inline` or placing them in specific sections can reduce latency and optimize memory usage. 

```cpp
inline void __attribute__((always_inline)) myISR() {
    // Fast ISR code
}
```

#### Scenario 2: Shared Constants Across Multiple Modules

For shared constants, declare them as `constexpr` in a header file included across multiple modules, allowing them to be stored in Flash memory and shared automatically:

```cpp
constexpr int SHARED_CONSTANT = 100;
```

### Conclusion

To instruct the compiler to optimize C++ code for embedded systems by sharing static code and constants, use `constexpr` and `const` for constants, `inline` and `static` for functions and methods, and leverage GCC-specific attributes and linker options to place code in specific memory sections. These techniques help ensure that the compiler understands the intended lifetime of objects and functions and optimizes memory usage accordingly.
