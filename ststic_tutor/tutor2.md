In C++, if you want to tell the compiler that an object will never be destroyed, and you want it to optimize accordingly (like sharing static code and constants), you can use several techniques. Let's go through these techniques and how they work:

### 1. Use `const` and `constexpr`
If you have objects that are constant and initialized at compile-time, you can use `const` and `constexpr`. This gives the compiler more information about the immutability and lifetime of objects.

```cpp
constexpr int value = 42;
```

When you declare an object as `constexpr`, it is known to be constant at compile time, and the compiler can optimize it heavily, even eliminating the object entirely if possible. Using `const` or `constexpr` tells the compiler that the value will not change, allowing for better optimization.

### 2. Use `static` Variables
If you want to share a common object or data among different instances or parts of your program, you can use `static` variables. Static variables are shared across all instances of a class or function scope and are initialized only once.

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    static const int sharedValue = 100;
};
```

Here, `sharedValue` is a `static` member of `MyClass`, and it is initialized only once. The compiler knows that this value won't change, and it can optimize accordingly.

### 3. `[[gnu::const]]` and `[[gnu::pure]]` Attributes (GCC/Clang Specific)
For GCC or Clang compilers, you can use `[[gnu::const]]` and `[[gnu::pure]]` attributes to specify that functions have no side effects or depend only on their arguments. This allows the compiler to optimize calls to these functions.

- `[[gnu::const]]` implies that a function does not read or modify any global memory.
- `[[gnu::pure]]` implies that a function may read global memory but does not modify it.

```cpp
[[gnu::const]] int pureFunction(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
```

### 4. `[[nodiscard]]` Attribute
`[[nodiscard]]` is a C++17 attribute that tells the compiler that the return value of a function should not be ignored. This can help prevent optimizations that might otherwise remove function calls that are presumed to have no side effects.

```cpp
[[nodiscard]] int calculateSomething() {
    return 42;
}
```

### 5. Using `alignas` and `alignof` for Optimization
If you want to optimize for memory layout and alignment, you can use the `alignas` specifier to explicitly control the alignment of objects in memory. This can help with optimizing access patterns and sharing common code paths.

```cpp
struct alignas(16) AlignedType {
    int a;
    float b;
};
```

### 6. Use `__attribute__((section("name")))` (GCC/Clang Specific)
You can use GCC or Clang-specific `__attribute__((section("name")))` to place objects in specific sections of memory, which can be useful for optimizations like sharing common constants.

```cpp
int myConst __attribute__((section(".rodata"))) = 42;
```

### 7. Global or Static Constant Initialization
If you declare a global or static object, it will be initialized only once, and the compiler might place it in a read-only section of memory that can be shared:

```cpp
const MyClass globalInstance;
```

Here, `globalInstance` is a global constant that will be initialized once and never destroyed, so the compiler can place it in a read-only section, optimizing accordingly.

### 8. Disable Destructor Calls
If you want to explicitly tell the compiler that a destructor should not be called (e.g., for objects that are statically allocated and will persist for the entire duration of the program), you can use placement new to construct an object and never call its destructor.

```cpp
void* memory = operator new(sizeof(MyClass));
MyClass* myObject = new (memory) MyClass();  // Placement new
// No delete called on myObject
```

### Conclusion
- Use `const` and `constexpr` for compile-time constants.
- Use `static` for shared values or variables.
- Use GCC/Clang attributes like `[[gnu::const]]`, `[[gnu::pure]]`, and section attributes for further optimization.
- Control memory layout and optimization using `alignas`, `alignof`, and `section`.
  
These techniques combined can help the compiler optimize code paths, share static code and constants, and potentially eliminate unnecessary object destruction.
